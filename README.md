## Introduction
In the fast-paced world of aviation, the ability to harness data for informed decision-making is crucial for the success and sustainability of an airline. As consultants for a startup airline operating out of the bustling Chicago, Illinois area, we recognize the unique challenges faced by the management team. While their expertise lies in the intricacies of airline operations, a lack of financial and data analytics experience, coupled with disparate systems, hampers their ability to extract valuable insights efficiently.

## Problem Statement

Navigating Data Disparity and Operational Inefficiencies in a Startup Airline
The startup airline based in the Chicago, Illinois area faces significant challenges stemming from a lack of financial and data analytics experience within its management team. Disparate and unconnected systems further exacerbate the situation, hindering the extraction of crucial insights necessary for informed decision-making. A recent revelation that aircraft details, such as routes and seating capacities, required manual comparison of multiple files underscores the pressing need for a robust and integrated data infrastructure.

Disparate Systems: The airline's existing systems lack cohesion and integration, leading to inefficiencies in data retrieval and analysis.

Data Retrieval Complexity: The inability to extract specific aircraft details from a single report has resulted in cumbersome manual processes, consuming valuable time, and resources.

Financial Blind Spots: Limited financial and data analytics experience within the management team restricts their ability to optimize costs, identify revenue streams, and make data-driven strategic decisions.

Operational Inefficiencies: The lack of streamlined data processes and analytics impedes overall operational efficiency, potentially affecting customer satisfaction and profitability.

Predictive analytics models enhancing the airline's ability to proactively respond to market dynamics.



## Visualization

Visualization
Data visualization is a process of representing information or data graphically to help people understand the patterns, trends, and insights within the data more effectively. It involves the creation of visual elements such as charts, graphs, and maps to communicate complex information in a clear and accessible manner.  Creating visualizations in Excel is a common and effective way to analyze and present data. Excel provides various tools and chart types that allow you to represent your data graphically
